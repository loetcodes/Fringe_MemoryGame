# Fringe_MemoryGame
Fringe memory game made using python and pygame

This is a memory game implemented in python using images/glyphs from one of my favorite sci-fi shows Fringe

Requirements:
To download and play the game you must have python and pygame installed.

This is a basic implementation using standard 4 by 4 grid of image glyphs.
I loved the show and the secret messages the glyphs represented-hence uploaded a memory game!!
